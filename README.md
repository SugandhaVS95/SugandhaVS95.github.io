## Journey Overview

Starting on August 1st, 2023, I'm embarking on a 90-day quest until November 31st to build a solid foundational knowledge of DevOps. Each day, I'll dedicate one hour to tackle over 13 essential areas of DevOps, capturing my experiences and learnings along the way. By documenting this journey, I hope to inspire others and enrich the resources available for the DevOps community.

Here are the key areas I'll be focusing on during my DevOps journey:

1. DevOps Principles
2. Continuous Integration (CI)
3. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
5. Containerization and Orchestration
6. Monitoring and Logging
7. DevOps Culture and Best Practices
8. and more...

## Linux in DevOps

Linux is an essential component of the DevOps ecosystem. It serves as the preferred operating system for many DevOps practitioners and organizations due to its flexibility, scalability, and open-source nature.

In DevOps, Linux plays a pivotal role in:

- Hosting and managing cloud infrastructure with platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- Running containerization platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes, enabling scalable and portable deployments.
- Automating configuration management through tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.
- Providing a secure and reliable environment for continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

As you progress in your DevOps journey, you'll encounter Linux in various aspects of infrastructure management and software delivery. Understanding Linux fundamentals will empower you to wield the full potential of DevOps technologies.
