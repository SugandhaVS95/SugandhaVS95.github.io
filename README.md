# My DevOps Journey



Welcome to my DevOps journey repository! 🚀 Starting on August 1st, 2023, I'm embarking on a 90-day quest until November 31st to build a solid foundational knowledge of DevOps.

My goal is to dedicate one hour each day to tackle over 13 essential areas of DevOps, capturing my experiences and learnings along the way. 📚💡 By documenting this journey, I hope to inspire others and enrich the resources available for the DevOps community.

While this adventure won't cover every aspect of DevOps, it will focus on the key areas I believe will greatly enhance my learning and understanding. Join me on this exciting ride as we delve into the world of DevOps together! 🎢🤖 #DevOpsJourney #LearningAdventure"
