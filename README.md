# My DevOps Journey

## This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". I will be starting this journey on the 1st August 2023 but the idea is that we take 100 days which just so happens to be August 1st to December 15th.

##The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

##This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
