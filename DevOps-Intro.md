Welcome to Day 1 of our thrilling 90-day adventure to master the foundational understanding of DevOps and its empowering tools! ðŸš€

Let's begin with a bit about my journey!

It all started back in 2019 while working at "TELUS International" in the BPO industry. Feeling the need for a change and eager to explore new horizons, I stumbled upon the term 'AWS'. Intrigued and curious, I decided to dive into the world of Cloud Computing.

Despite facing challenges, including lack of formal IT education and limited resources, I was determined to learn and grow. Learning discreetly during office hours, I was captivated by Cloud Computing's vastness and potential. Even without a laptop and amidst financial constraints, I persevered, fueled by the vision of a brighter future.

The journey had its ups and downs, including family situations and financial hurdles. But I refused to give up. In March 2022, a golden opportunity at Tech Mahindra allowed me to focus on Networking in the 'Project- Net Gear'. It was then that I realized the vastness of the tech world, prompting me to embrace the DevOps culture, tools, and processes.

As I embarked on this new chapter, I engaged with the community, soaking in knowledge and experiences. Today, I'm excited to share my learning journey publicly, documenting the areas I wish to explore further.
