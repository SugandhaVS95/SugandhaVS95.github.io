While talking about DevOps, three things are important continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery.

**Add Image here**

- ## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is a software development method in which the developers' code gets integrated several times a day. Whenever a developer checks-in the code, each time the change is verified by an automated pipeline(server) and gives early feedback, in case if there are any bugs.



- ## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery comes after CI and it is the ability to introduce changes with every commit, making the code ready for production so that it can be deployed to production on demand and as a routine activity. Code changes can be like new features, bug fixes, updates, configuration changes, etc. One important thing to note here is to ensure safety checks, so the bugs get detected before they get promoted to the production.



- ## Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment is one step ahead from Continuous Delivery, here, every change in the source code by the developer is deployed to production just automatically, without explicit approval from a developer.
