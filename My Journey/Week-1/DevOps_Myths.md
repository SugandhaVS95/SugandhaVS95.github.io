# Common DevOps Myths

There are plenty of DevOps myths circulating the developers’ community. This is no surprise, considering how much excitement the DevOps concept has brought over the recent years.

The DevOps methodology can provide significant positive effects for organizations when implemented properly. It can lower costs, boost efficiency, and make the work of development teams more streamlined.

However, in order to grasp the strength of this process, it is necessary to recognize what DevOps represents. That’s why, in this article, we address some of the most popular DevOps myths.

**Despite the widespread adoption and success of DevOps practices, there are some common myths or misconceptions that surround this approach. Let's shed some light on these myths**

- ## DevOps is all about CI/CD:
One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s the same thing as CI/CD. The truth is that continuous integration and delivery are the key components of DevOps.

DevOps focuses on the culture and responsibility in a team. It emphasizes the need for everyone on the team to take part in each other’s tasks. This improves collaboration and communication in the team.

On the other hand, CI/CD enables this culture with software and tools that emphasize automation. You can see them as a means to an end.

- ## DevOps is all about tools:
Conversations about DevOps are mostly focused around which tools your company is using. They then turn into philosophical battles about what are the best tools. Instead, we should be communicating about the bigger picture, the business value DevOps brings to your company.

DevOps means focusing on culture, mindset, and how individuals work together. Only after should you be choosing the right tools for your processes. Teams often look in the large ecosystem of tools trying to find the perfect solution at the beginnings. They build DevOps pipelines for a very long time, that should be redone once completed.

An [Atlassian research](https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a87265a6-4a4d-4905-97e9-4129ac78563c/Atlassian%20DevOps%20Trends%20Survey%202020.pdf) showed that the two main factors to implement DevOps successfully are the right tools and the right people.

DevOps automation tools like [Microtica](https://www.microtica.com/?utm_source=devto&utm_medium=referral_link&utm_campaign=devops_myths) allow you to create pipelines and test them in hours. With these kinds of tools, you can save months of work on pipelines that might not function.

- ## DevOps Replaces IT Operations:
Myth: Some believe that DevOps is about eliminating IT operations roles altogether, as everything is automated and managed by developers.
Reality: DevOps does not replace IT operations; it enhances and transforms their roles. DevOps encourages closer collaboration between developers and operations teams, but each group still has its unique expertise. Operations teams focus on designing and maintaining stable, scalable, and secure infrastructures, while developers work on creating and delivering code. The two groups collaborate to optimize the entire software delivery process.

- ## Software release is the same as in Amazon/Facebook/Google:
Many world-leading companies have adopted DevOps for its benefits and flexibility. Looking at these company’s success stories, we, of course, look up to their achievements. We do this without realizing their context and the steps they made to become that successful.

One thing is for sure – these organizations chose and built the tools and processes that worked best for them at the time. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to follow these organizations. Moreover, what they did won’t magically work for our business as well.

We should learn from them and find new ways to innovate and grow. Explore and find the right processes and tools that define our problem space. What will bring success to our particular business? This is what DevOps is all about.

-  ## One-size-fits-all continuous delivery pipeline:
The idea that you can have one process that fits all teams and companies is impossible, contrary to popular belief. Every organization has different needs and requirements. Even projects in the same organization need different continuous delivery pipelines.

You can have projects that need only two to three environments. For example, development, test, and production environments with frequent deployments. Another project can require more environments since it has multiple stages in the software delivery cycle.

This is why the continuous delivery pipeline should represent the release process that the company is already using.

- ## DevOps is Only for Startups or Web Companies:
Myth: There's a misconception that DevOps is only suitable for startups or web-based companies and may not be relevant for large enterprises or traditional industries.
Reality: DevOps principles can benefit organizations of all sizes and across various industries. While startups and web companies were early adopters due to their need for rapid iterations and quick releases, enterprises can also reap the rewards of DevOps by improving efficiency, reducing lead times, and increasing overall productivity.

- ## DevOps Means No More Manual Work:
Myth: Some assume that DevOps eliminates the need for any manual work, and everything is automated.
Reality: While automation is a vital aspect of DevOps, some tasks may still require manual intervention, especially in complex scenarios or for unique requirements. DevOps aims to automate repetitive and error-prone tasks, allowing teams to focus on high-value activities, but manual work may still be necessary in certain situations.

- ## DevOps Solves All Problems Instantly:
Myth: There's a misconception that adopting DevOps will instantly solve all IT-related problems and lead to flawless software delivery.
Reality: DevOps is a continuous improvement journey, and its success relies on a commitment to a culture of continuous learning and iteration. It won't eliminate all issues overnight, but it provides a framework for teams to address challenges more effectively and adapt to changing needs.

- ## DevOps is Only about Development and Operations:
Myth: The name "DevOps" might suggest that it's only relevant for development and operations teams.
Reality: While DevOps emerged from the collaboration of development and operations, its principles extend beyond these teams. DevOps values cross-functional collaboration, involving stakeholders from QA, security, product management, and other departments to work together towards common goals.


- ## DevOps Replaces Agile:

Many believe that DevOps is a logical continuation of the Agile. Agile focuses on small teams continously delivering high-quality code to customers and many devops came out from that point of potentially shippable code to a point where they are actually useable.


- ## DevOps is incompatible with ITIL:

ITIL, for those who are not aware of it, is a library of practices aimed at codifying the practices and processes in the IT Operations (Ops). DevOps practices can be made compatible with ITIL. For shorter lead times and higher deployment frequencies many parts of ITIL need to be automated. Also, ITIL disciplines like service design, incident and problem management are relevant as DevOps requires faster detection and recovery.


- ## Devops is incompatible with Information Security and Compliance:

The absence of traditional controls may incur the disapproval of many infosec and compliance pros. The info sec and compliance actions are integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle rather than being performed at the end of the project


- ## DevOps means NoOps:
NoOps describes the concept where the cloud infrastructure is so automated, that there is no need to manage it.

NoOps is considered as the next evolution of DevOps as a development model. Just like DevOps, its goal is to improve software delivery, but by allowing developers to focus on application development instead of infrastructure and maintenance.

By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, you can automate the setup, deployment, and monitoring processes, getting closer to NoOps.


- ## Automation eliminates all bottlenecks:
Automation is one of the biggest benefits that DevOps provides. But it’s not a silver bullet that will solve all your problems.

A continuous delivery process enables teams to roll out new features quickly. And, get the feedback they need really fast. This, of course, means that you have to ensure the product’s quality. Moreover, you have to take care of how well it runs and its performance when scaling. You also need to ensure smooth production deployments.

Automating your CI/CD pipelines helps eliminate the bottlenecks between code commit and deploy. But, this is just one stage of the software delivery process. Unless developers and testers are in a partnership, you won’t be able to resolve all your problems. It’s likely that you’ll only move any bottlenecks to another stream.

- ## Release all the time:
The idea of frequent releases has companies worried about not releasing their software continuously enough. “Ship often” has become the industry standard. However, this doesn’t specify the time. It may be every two to three weeks, or it may be several times a day.

The most important thing is that you achieve the team confidence that enables you to release new software when required. CD is the ability to release code from the main branch and feel confident in it. The idea of DevOps is that your code should be releasable anytime.

So remember, continuous delivery doesn’t mean you should release as often as you can but gives you the ability to release as often as you want. How often should be up to your company’s decision.


- ## DevOps is only for OpenSource software:
DevOps outcomes can be achieved independent of the technology being used.


**Understanding and dispelling these myths can help organizations embrace DevOps more effectively and leverage its true potential to drive innovation, efficiency, and success in software delivery.**
