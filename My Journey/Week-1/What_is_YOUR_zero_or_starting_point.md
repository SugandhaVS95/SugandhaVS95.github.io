# What is YOUR zero or starting point? 

So having those DevOps skills is the final goal and you're starting from zero, but many of you are transitioning to DevOps or starting your DevOps journey having **various different backgrounds.** So **the zero or that starting point is different for all of you** and as I mentioned at the beginning you may be systems administrator or software engineer or QA engineer etc or may not have an IT background at all and want to transition into DevOps:

ADD IMAGE- zero

So now I want to show you how you can transition to DevOps and basically learn all these tools that I just mentioned starting from your specific background. ‚úÖ


# Starting as a Systems Administrator üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª
If you are a systems administrator you know how to administer servers and other systems. So you already have some skills in:

- setting up infrastructure
- configuring and preparing it for deployment
- so working with operating systems, installing and running software
- security, networking configuration etc is already familiar for you.

Some of the other tasks you do as systems administrator are things like monitoring systems, health, backup and disaster recovery, installing and patching servers and so on.

In smaller projects you may have to also do database administration, network administration or security administration.

All of these are very useful skills, if you want to become a DevOps engineer. üëç So you already have a lot of skills you can use in the deployment and operations side of DevOps:

**ADD IMAGE- ZERO-1**

This includes Day 0 activities such as initial setup of the infrastructure, but also Day 1 tasks like maintaining and operating this infrastructure.

Many systems administrators also know scripting, so that will be helpful in the automation part of DevOps. So as a systems administrator you already have a very good foundation to get into DevOps, however the big part missing here to start in DevOps is learning the **software development basics:**

- understanding the git workflows
- how developers work and so on

Now very important to note, even though some DevOps engineers do know how to program, it's not an essential skill in DevOps, because as a DevOps engineer your **main task is not developing and programming the application it's creating automated processes for delivering the developed software to the end users efficiently with as few bugs and issues as possible:**

**ADD IMAGE-ZERO-2**

But to be able to deliver the application changes, of course you need to understand how that application was built, developed and how it works.


# Starting as a Software Developer üë©‚Äçüíª

If you are a software developer, again you have a pretty good background, because you already know an important part of DevOps, which is the software development processes and how these work.

But most probably you are **missing skills in server management.** So you need to start by learning about:

- virtual machines
- creating and configuring servers
- configuring infrastructure security, networking etc


And since most modern applications run on cloud, you need to also learn how to do all these on cloud infrastructure.

So that would be your starting point when learning DevOps as a software developer.

And once you have that foundation you can build on that by learning about how containers work on top of the virtual machines and how to run applications in containers and how to run containers on a platform like Kubernetes etc.

And of course your programming skills will be great help in writing automated scripts for various parts of the application development and deployment processes. üëç


# Starting as a Test Automation Engineerüë®üèº‚Äçüíª

Another common background people have when transitioning into DevOps is a test automation engineer. Now here you may have **a bit more catching up** to do and more skills to learn compared to developers or systems administrators, but you can definitely reuse many of your skills in DevOps.

As a test engineer you most probably know how the software developers are working, like the agile processes, Jira workflows and so on. And as part of your test automation knowledge **you understand the different testing scopes** like

- testing on code level
- testing the whole application on a more abstract level
- testing how the application integrates with other services etc.

You also understand **how to test different aspects of an application** and that knowledge is really helpful for setting up an automated CI/CD pipeline, because in order to automate the pipeline and streamline delivering your application changes all the way to the production environment, you need extensive automated testing:

**Add Image-zero-3**

Because as soon as you need a human element you will break the automated pipeline and add a bottleneck:

**Add Image-zero-4**

And since you know how to write automated tests in various programming languages, your skills in various testing frameworks is definitely helpful here for scripting and coding some automation parts of DevOps processes. Or let's say it won't be completely new to you. üëç


# Starting as a Network Engineerüßëüèª‚Äçüíª

The last honorable mention of a background going into DevOps is network engineering. This is probably the farthest from DevOps compared to the other three that I just mentioned, but you still have some skills that you can bring into DevOps as a network engineer.

As a network engineer you know how to configure devices and networking between devices. So you have **valuable knowledge in configuring networking for infrastructure on premise.**

- Transition to Cloud Network Engineer
But as most companies are moving their infrastructure to cloud, many network engineers transition to cloud network engineering:

**Add Image-zero-5**

So they do all of that on cloud platforms. And instead of configuring routes and switches and networks on on-premise infrastructure, they configure **virtual routes and virtual switches and virtual networks on cloud infrastructure.**

With networking and virtual networking knowledge you have an **advantage to understand networking in virtual machines and containers, which is a big part of how modern applications are running.** So it will be easier for you to understand Docker and Kubernetes networking for example and these are usually pretty difficult parts to manage and troubleshoot or secure, when you're configuring and maintaining the deployment environments with Kubernetes and containers on them.

So you can definitely use your knowledge and expertise in this area. Some network engineers even know scripting in bash or python for example, which is another helpful skill when it comes to automation part of DevOps.

# Starting with no or little IT background üôâ

Finally, we also **get many questions about starting our DevOps Bootcamp with very little to no IT background.** Which means there are probably many of you reading this article, who are thinking about getting into DevOps without much IT pre-knowledge and want to know what the path is to DevOps.

Now this is a very tricky one, because **DevOps is NOT really the entry-level profession in it.** It's not the first thing you learn when you want to get into the IT field.
Now why is that? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Because DevOps is about **automating processes and software development and deployment that people have done manually for a very long time.*

This means before you automate processes and tasks that are done manually, you first need to understand what those **processes and tasks are in the first place.** If you don't understand those, you won't know what you're automating or why you even need DevOps.

- ## Understand complete software development lifecycle
So if you're completely new to IT and already know you want to eventually become a DevOps engineer, then you should start by understanding the complete software development life cycle first. And the good news is, it's easier than it sounds. You don't need to go and learn software development for months for that and you definitely don't need to become an expert in managing infrastructure and configuring servers.

If you learn the right things, you can actually do it in a relatively short time:
Go find some example projects, where you create a super simple application and learn how to deploy to a virtual server, so learning the steps of developing, packaging, maybe even automatically testing and then deploying an example application on a Linux server on a cloud platform.

This will actually be a very good foundational knowledge for building on it to learn DevOps. In this process

- you will learn the basics of creating an application,
- you will learn how to create a virtual machine with a Linux server on some easy to use cloud platform and host your application there.

And then repeat the whole process once more, simulating making an update to your application and this will **teach you basic skills for each part of the software development process,** but most importantly it will make you understand the complete workflow of what goes into that. üëÄ

You don't need any fancy tools for that, no Jenkins, no fancy programming framework, not even Git. Again these are to understand the basic concepts and then you can start learning those DevOps tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and so on. Because **this phase is not about learning the tools, it's about understanding the concepts and the complete workflow.**

- ## How software development teams collaborate
After that go ahead and watch some tutorials about agile and scrum methods and how software development teams collaborate and work in software development projects.

- ## DevOps Pre-Requisites and 4 - DevOps Skills
And these skills will actually be enough to start our DevOps Bootcamp, because Linux, Git and all these basic tools you actually learn in our bootcamp from scratch. üöÄ But again you need to understand those workflows first in order to understand, why we're using Git, why we need Jenkins, why we're learning Linux and scripting etc.



# Summary - DevOps Roadmap
So to summarize there are 4 phases:

- ## Getting the pre-requisites right
First one getting the prerequisites right. So depending on which background and pre-knowledge you have, you need to first make sure to get any missing prerequisite knowledge.

So as a system administrator or a network engineer, learn the software development workflows. As a developer, learn the basics of infrastructure, virtual servers etc. Of course with zero IT background, you have to get all this prerequisite knowledge from server administration to development first. So you have a more difficult entry, but it is possible if you know what to learn.

- ## Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes
Second step is learning cloud, Docker and Kubernetes. After learning the prerequisites, you can already get started with important DevOps skills of working with containers and container orchestration tools. So basically learning Docker and Kubernetes to help your teams deploy and efficiently run the application. Kubernetes itself is a very complex tool, so it may take some time to master it and make it production ready.

And since most of the modern applications and Kubernetes clusters are running on cloud, you need to learn cloud infrastructure, how to work with cloud infrastructure, how to configure it, how to scale it and so on.

- ## Automation
The third step is automation. Once you have mastered the above skills and technologies it's time to learn how to optimize and automate the existing processes. And as a DevOps professional automation skills are one of the most important ones.

As the heart of DevOps, learning to build CI/CD pipelines is an essential skill.

And finally you will learn how to automate parts of the complete DevOps processes one by one using the concepts and tools of what's called X as code, including Infrastructure as Code, Configuration as Code, Security as Code, Policy as Code and so on, which basically means just automating everything in the form of code

- ## Go from there. Keep learning üôå
Number four is just go from there. DevOps is evolving and new tools are being developed all the time. So as a DevOps professional, you should learn how to evaluate and test many new tools, always with the same goal to optimize and automate existing processes and make them efficient.
